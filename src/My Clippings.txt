The per-unit cost of delivering potable tap water would come down only if a single firm were to offer this service. That way, there would be no duplication of capital costs, and the capital cost for a single operator would get distributed over the large volume of water delivered. This implies that there is room only for a single firm—that is, a monopoly.

Therefore, private firms borrow less and do not invest in new projects. In fact, they get out of some of the existing investment projects, for loans are costly. The fall in private investments naturally has an adverse impact on employment generation and income. In economics, this phenomenon is called the ‘Crowding Out’ of private investments by public borrowing.

Once the US dollar was devalued against the British pound, US producers would be able to export more since one British pound could then buy more goods from the US. The increase in exports would give a boost to domestic production and employment in the US but would, perhaps, lead to reduced production and a lower rate of employment in Great Britain.

France captured Ruhr, the industrial province of Germany. Germans workers adopted a method of passive resistance by not working in the factories, though Germany continued to pay their wages. As a result, the printed money that was paid as reparations and the wages for no-work in Ruhr created a demand for goods and services for which there was no corresponding output in the market. The end result was hyperinflation. From 1922 to 1923, the average inflation exceeded 3000 percent.

Then everything went wrong for the Chinese Communists. The Americans ordered the Japanese, who still held vast areas of China, to surrender only to Chiang’s forces. Using his status as the head of China’s internationally recognized government, Chiang negotiated a deal with Stalin, in which the Guomindang was given control of Manchuria in return for concessions to the Soviets for future economic and military activities there. Even worse, the Chinese living along the eastern seaboard—the most populous regions of the country, which had been occupied by Japan during the war—welcomed Chiang’s forces back as liberating heroes when they arrived aboard American transport planes.

What remained of the virgin lands campaign and similar Soviet campaigns in central Asia, Siberia, the Caucasus, and in Soviet eastern Europe was a mixture of peoples and cultures, which added to the deportations Stalin had carried out in creating truly multicultural sites throughout the Soviet Union. In Kazakhstan there were more Russians than Kazakhs in 1970; in Turkmenia and in Estonia, only about two-thirds of the population were Turkmen or Estonians. The rest came from population groups all over the Soviet Union, though the main part of the migrants tended to be Russian.

In the 1950s, as they sensed this was at last becoming possible, they threw themselves into production with a vengeance. West Germans worked longer hours than most Europeans, and productivity expanded rapidly. As a result, their purchasing power almost doubled from 1950 to 1960,

The rapid transformation of China in the 1950s would not have been possible without Soviet aid. The Soviet assistance program for China was not only the biggest Moscow ever undertook outside its own borders. It was also, in relative terms, the biggest such program undertaken by any country anywhere, including the US Marshall Plan for Europe. The total from 1946 to 1960 amounted to around $25 billion in today’s prices, a little bit less than 1 percent of the Soviet GDP yearly.

Educational reform was another main Soviet influence.

Taking it away from them could be politically dangerous. But Mao’s impatience, supported by younger CCP members who regarded collectivization as de rigueur for a Communist state, in the end won the day.

By all indications collectivization in China had been a major success both politically and economically.

The causes were many. China suspected, with some justification, Nehru’s government to be sympathetic to Tibetan nationalists.

US support was the main reason why the European colonial empires did not all collapse in the 1940s, but went on for another two (or, in the Portuguese case, three) decades. After 1945, no European country was financially capable of keeping its colonial possessions given the poor state of their own economies and their defense needs in Europe. The chimera of colonialism could only be continued as long as the United States was willing to underwrite these countries’ other expenses at home. All of the colonial countries were of course aware of this, and did their best to present their reluctance to decolonize as part of a common struggle against Communism.

The survivors settled in the Sierra Maestra, a mountain range in southeastern Cuba, where Castro, his brother Raúl, and the Argentinian Communist Ernesto “Che” Guevara proved themselves to be competent guerrilla leaders, skillfully setting up campaigns against Batista’s regime and recruiting adherents among local peasants, workers on sugarcane plantations, and urban youth who traveled to join them. In 1958, when the Batista regime started to get into real trouble because of its economic incompetence, its internal divisions, and clashes with the Eisenhower Administration, Castro’s forces began operating all over eastern Cuba. With his government collapsing around him, Batista left the country with as much of his vast fortune as he could grab. On 2 January 1959 the revolutionaries entered the capital, Havana, in triumph.

For the revolutionaries, the failed Bay of Pigs invasion opened up new opportunities. Meeting with US representatives that summer, Che Guevara said “that he wanted to thank us [the United States] very much for the invasion—that it had been a great political victory for them—enabled them to consolidate—and transformed them from an aggrieved little country to an equal.”

Although policy-makers worldwide did not see it at the time, Vietnam was in many ways different from the rest of Asia. It was the only place where Communism became a dominant outlet for nationalism almost from the beginning. Even in countries where the Communist movement grew very big, such as in China, Korea, or Indonesia, this was a much more gradual phenomenon

For these young men and women, nationalism and Marxism were one. They believed that only by developing their movement, their nation, and their state according to Marxist laws of evolution could Vietnam truly succeed in the modern world. Their program was long-term, expansive, and utopian, but its implementation was dependent on first achieving independence and national unity.

The domino theory, first invented for China, was moved to Vietnam. To them, the Cold War was a zero-sum game, in which a loss for one side was a gain for the other. And the Soviet Union, or, even worse, China, was seen as controlling Vietnamese Communism and standing to gain through its success.

Kennedy’s biggest mistake on Vietnam was always to view the south and the north as two different countries. From this followed that the northern military involvement in the south was an invasion, and that the Communist great powers—and China especially—were behind the aggression. This line of thinking, which the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, took over from Kennedy, linked the Vietnam War directly to the Cold War.

The western European welfare state of the 1960s was only possible because of the combination of demographic growth, US consent, and fears over the ghosts of the past. Also, it demanded strong political leadership and an exchange of technology, products, and ideas across borders. Throughout western Europe, Social Democrats and Christian Democrats supplied the leadership necessary for creating a high degree of consensus around basic welfare provisions, while also preparing to fight the Cold War.

Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of his family. 2. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field. 3. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling. 4. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep. 5. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.

In many ways the East India Company was a model of commercial efficiency: one hundred years into its history, it had only thirty-five permanent employees in its head office. Nevertheless, that skeleton staff executed a corporate coup unparalleled in history: the military conquest, subjugation and plunder of vast tracts of southern Asia. It almost certainly remains the supreme act of corporate violence in world history.

In the years that followed his death, the authority of the Mughal state began to dissolve, first in the Deccan and then, as the Maratha armies headed northwards under their great war leader Baji Rao, in larger and larger areas of central and western India, too. Mughal succession disputes and a string of weak and powerless emperors exacerbated the sense of imperial crisis: three emperors were murdered (one was, in addition, first blinded with a hot needle); the mother of one ruler was strangled and the father of another forced off a precipice on his elephant. In the worst year of all, 1719, four different Emperors occupied the Peacock Throne in rapid succession.

The Mughal Nawab of the Carnatic, Anwar ud-Din, was furious with Dupleix for ignoring his orders by attacking Madras without his permission, and then insulting him by refusing to hand over the captured town to his authority. He had no intention of allowing a trading company to defy his rule in this manner, so he sent his son, Mahfuz Khan, with the entire Mughal army of the Carnatic, to punish the French.

Clive surprised the French and their allies by attacking in the middle of a thunderstorm, and soon raised the Nawab’s Mughal colours from the gates. His victory gave the first indication that the Company could manage a successful military campaign in India, either against Indian troops, who had until then often defeated them, or against the French, who only a few years before had been the first to demonstrate the possibilities of modern infantry and field artillery techniques over Indian cavalry armies.

Two days later, the Nawab wrote Clive a letter which the latter took as giving Siraj’s assent for an attack on the French. This was in return for an EIC promise of military assistance should Bengal be attacked by the Afghan monarch Ahmed Shah Durrani, who had just seized Delhi on the first of what were to be seventeen annual raids on north India, and who was said to be planning a looting expedition eastwards.

In addition, the EIC was to get zamindari – landholding – rights near Calcutta, a mint in the town and confirmation of duty-free trade. By 19 May, in addition to this offer, Mir Jafar conceded to pay the EIC a further enormous sum – £1 million* – as compensation for the loss of Calcutta and another half a million as compensation to its European inhabitants.

Clive’s winnings in 1757 was a story of personal enrichment very much in the spirit of the Caribbean privateers who had first founded the Company 157 years earlier: it was all about private fortunes for the officers and dividends for the Company, about treasure rather than glory, plunder rather than power. Yet this was only the beginning: in total around £1,238,575 was given by Mir Jafar to the Company and its servants, which included at least £170,000 personally for Clive. In all, perhaps £2.5 million was given to the Company by the Murshidabad Nawabs in the eight years between 1757 and 1765 as ‘political gifts’. Clive himself estimated the total payments as closer to ‘three million sterling’.*88

It was at Plassey that the Company had triumphantly asserted itself as a strong military force within the Mughal Empire. The Marathas who had terrorised and looted Bengal in the 1740s were remembered as cruel and violent. The Company’s plunder of the same region a decade later was more orderly and methodical, but its greed was arguably deadlier because it was more skilful and relentless and, above all, more permanent

Just before Clive left, Mir Jafar had been able to pay only three of his army’s thirteen months’ arrears of pay. As a result the unpaid troops were openly mutinous and some were starving: ‘their horses are mere skeletons,’ he wrote, ‘and their riders little better. Even the Jamadars [officers] are many of them clothed with rags.’9 It had taken only three years since Plassey to impoverish what had recently been probably the wealthiest town in India.

After Plassey, unregulated private English traders began fanning out across Bengal, taking over markets and asserting their authority in a way that had been impossible for them before the Revolution. By 1762, at least thirty-three of these private businesses had set themselves up in more than 400 new British trading posts around the province. Here they defied the power of local officials, refusing to pay the few taxes, tolls or customs duties they were still required to pay, as well as encroaching upon land to which they were not entitled. In this manner they ate away at the economy of Bengal like an invasion of termites steadily gnawing at the inside of an apparently sturdy wooden structure.16

Mir Ashraf and the influential Jagat Seths had turned against the new regime and were actively writing letters to the one force they thought might still be able to liberate Bengal from the encroachments of the Company. This was the new Mughal Emperor, Shah Alam, who since his escape from Delhi had been wandering the Ganges plains, actively looking for a kingdom to rule, and surrounding himself with followers hoping for a return of the old Mughal order.28

Apart from money, what Shah Alam really lacked was a modern European-style infantry regiment, and the artillery which would allow him to besiege walled cities. Shortly before he learned of his father’s death, however, fortune brought him a partial solution to both in the person of the dashing fugitive French commander of Scottish extraction, Jean Law de Lauriston. Law had managed to escape from Bengal soon after the twin disasters of the fall of Chandernagar and the Battle of Plassey temporarily ended French ambitions in eastern and northern India. He was still on the run from the Company when he came across the royal camp.

Ever since the time Akbar made his former Rajput enemy Raja Jai Singh the commander of his army, the Mughals had always had the happy knack of turning their former enemies into useful allies. Perhaps now, Shah Alam seems to have wondered, he could use the British in the same way Akbar used the Rajputs to effect his ends? In the eyes of most Indians the Company lacked any legal right to rule. It was in Shah Alam’s power to grant them the legitimacy they needed. Maybe an alliance could be formed, and British arms could carry him back to Delhi, remove the usurper, Imad ul-Mulk, and restore him to his rightful throne?

Buxar was a short and confused battle, but a bloody one: Company forces lost 850 killed, wounded or missing, of the 7,000 men they brought to the field – more than an eighth of their total; Mughal losses were many times higher, perhaps as many as 5,000 dead. For a long time the day’s outcome was uncertain. But for all this, it was still, ultimately, one of the most decisive battles in Indian history, even more so than the more famous Battle of Plassey seven years earlier.

In reality, there were other remedies to hand which did not require divine intervention. Famines had been a baleful feature of Indian history from time immemorial, whenever the rains failed. But for centuries, and certainly by the time of the Mughals, elaborate systems of grain stores, public works and famine relief measures had been developed to blunt the worst effect of the drought. Even now, some of the more resourceful and imaginative Mughal administrators took initiatives to import rice and set up gruel kitchens.13

The colossal loan of £1.4 million* that the Company needed in order to stave off its looming bankruptcy would be agreed to. But, in return, the Company agreed to subject itself to a Regulating Act, defined by Lord North’s India Bill of June 1773, which would bring the EIC under greater parliamentary scrutiny.

In the decade following the defeat of the Marathas at Panipat in 1761, and the death of 35,000 – an entire generation of Maratha warriors and leaders – the Afghans had had the upper hand in Hindustan from roughly 1761 until 1770.14 In

In contrast to the failing and retreating Durrani monarchy, the Marathas had produced two rival young leaders who had showed both the determination and the military ability to recover and expand Maratha fortunes in the north. The first of these was the young Mahadji Scindia.

Few believed Shah Alam had much of a chance of getting safely back to Delhi. Fewer still believed he had any hope of re-establishing Mughal rule there, or of achieving any meaningful independence from the Marathas, who clearly wished to use him for their own ends, just as the Company had done. But if anyone could help Shah Alam succeed on all these fronts, Najaf Khan was the man.

He and Mirza Najaf Khan had two immediate targets in sight: the Jat Raja of Deeg had usurped much of the territory immediately south of the capital, between Delhi and Agra. But more pressing than that was the need to bring to heel the rogue Rohilla leader Zabita Khan, who now stood accused of disobeying the Emperor’s summons, as well as dishonouring his sister.

Nor was it clear that any sort of final peace had now come to the city. In the aftermath of the capture of Pathargarh, the fragile new alliance between the Mughals and the Marathas already appeared to be near collapse as the two sides fought over the division of the spoils: ‘the faithless Marathas have seized all the artillery and treasures of Zabita Khan, as well as his elephants, horses and other property,’ reported a palace newswriter, ‘and have offered only a worthless fraction to the Emperor.’

Things could easily have turned out very badly for Shah Alam, but at the last minute he was saved. In early September 1773, an unexpected message arrived by express courier from Pune, announcing the premature death from consumption of the young Maratha Peshwa, Narayan Rao. A violent succession dispute quickly followed, pitting the many different factions in the Maratha Confederacy against each other. As news arrived in Delhi of the fight for control, both Scindia and his rival Holkar realised it was essential that they return south to Pune as fast as they could in order to secure their interests. In their hurry to get to Pune, they both departed within the week, leaving Shah Alam and Mirza Najaf Khan in complete, unmediated control of Delhi.

The Marathas, having helped install Shah Alam back in power in Delhi, now withdrew for several years, while they battled among themselves. By the monsoon of 1773, Shah Alam found himself no longer the powerless puppet he had been for so much of his life, but the surprised sovereign of his own dominions, with one of the greatest generals of the eighteenth century as his commander.

Hastings replied that he believed the Company held Bengal through ‘the natural charter’ of the sword. In 1774, Hastings finally made the formal decision to cease all payments to Shah Alam.81 The loss to Shah Alam’s treasury was severe, and it meant he could rarely pay his troops their full salary.

Three successive failed monsoons, followed by a severe famine spreading across Hindustan, sweeping away around a fifth of the rural population, added to the sense of chaos and breakdown.92 In Lucknow at the same time, the Nawab Asaf ud-Daula built his great Imambara mourning hall in order to provide employment for 40,000 people as famine relief work; but Shah Alam did not have the resources for anything like this.93 The poet Sauda articulated in his letters the growing sense of despair: ‘The royal treasury is empty,’ he wrote.

Earlier in his career, Burke had defended Robert Clive against parliamentary enquiry, and so helped exonerate someone who genuinely was a ruthlessly unprincipled plunderer. Now he directed his skills of oratory against Warren Hastings, a man who, by virtue of his position, was certainly the symbol of an entire system of mercantile oppression in India, but who had personally done much to begin the process of regulating and reforming the Company, and who had probably done more than any other Company official to rein in the worst excesses of its rule.

After Francis’s departure, Hastings began to take a more old-fashioned, pseudo-monarchical and even despotic idea of his powers, something Burke particularly disliked.16 Moreover, during the military crisis of the early 1780s, in the aftermath of victories by the armies of Tipu and the Marathas, when it looked as if the Company might easily be driven out of India, Hastings had been forced to raise money quickly to fight the war and to save Madras and Calcutta. He chose to raise it by pressuring the Company’s princely allies to contribute, and he used some extremely dubious means to gather the sums he needed. These included bullying the Nawab of Lucknow, Asaf ud-Daula, forcefully to strip the wealth of his purdah-bound aunts, the Begums of Avadh.

After a period on the edge, the Company was now back in business and making a healthy profit. Part of these profits came from the successful introduction of new cash crops like sugar, opium and indigo, but much was simply due to the natural fecundity of Bengal, which always produced large surpluses of rice each year.

All this meant that the Company state was able to keep building its army and apportion over £3 million annually to military expenditure, a sum no other South Asian power could possibly match.31 From 2,900 sepoys in 1757 after Plassey, the Bengal army had grown to around 50,000 men by the arrival of Cornwallis.

So when, in 1791, war once again loomed with Tipu Sultan of Mysore, Cornwallis’s armies could now draw on unprecedented manpower, weaponry and military materiel. There was good reason for the Company generals to be confident: if war with Tipu was unavoidable they would now have a good opportunity of avenging their abject defeat at Pollilur twelve years earlier.

He suggested that Tipu’s best chance of doing this lay in dividing and ruling: ‘The resources of Hindustan do not suffice to expel the English from the lands they have invaded. Put the nations of Europe one against the other. It is by the aid of the French that you could conquer the British armies, which are better trained than those of India. The Europeans have surer tactics; always use against them their own weapons.’

Tipu had already proved his capacity to do this on the battlefield, defeating the Company not only at Pollilur but also twice more since then: in 1782, he had annihilated another British army under Colonel John Braithwaite just outside Tanjore and then, a year later, immediately before his accession, ambushed and destroyed a third Company column on the banks of the Coleroon River.

Allied to this often counter-productive aggression and megalomania was a fatal lack of diplomatic skills. When Cornwallis reached Calcutta in September 1786, Tipu was already at war with both the Maratha Peshwa and the Nizam of Hyderabad, both of whom had been allies of his father.

and he was forced to send a message to Cornwallis, through some captured Company officers, suggesting peace negotiations. Cornwallis accepted, but his terms were severe: Tipu must surrender half his kingdom, and pay an indemnity of 30 million rupees,* release all his prisoners of war, and give his two eldest sons as hostages to guarantee full payment. The borderlands next to the Marathas were to be handed over to the Peshwa; those next to Hyderabad to the Nizam; and the Company was to receive his territories in the Eastern Ghats as well as those in Coorg and spice-rich Malabar. The treaty was finally signed, and the two young princes – Abdul Khaliq, who was eight, and Muizuddin, aged five – handed over to Cornwallis on 18 March 1792.

In 1971 the US government acted to defend its own economic interest. By abruptly suspending the fixed rate of exchanging dollars for gold, it in effect devalued the US dollar against other currencies, helping American exporters and domestic business. It thereby deliberately destroyed the Bretton Woods system, in which most other currencies had been pegged to the dollar at a fixed exchange rate.

For Brezhnev the summit was the highlight of his career as a statesman. Not only did the SALT agreement assume that the Soviet Union had reached parity with the United States in terms of strategic nuclear forces and was therefore militarily its equal, but the US president was willing to accept a general text, which included some of the key concepts that the Soviets had put forward in international relations over the past twenty years.

Nixon’s trouble with the law engulfed his presidency soon after his reelection in 1972. The president was found to have interfered with the investigation of a break-in at the headquarters of his Democratic opponents at the Watergate building in Washington. The burglary had been carried out on the orders of White House officials, and pressure on Nixon to testify increased. When it became clear that he faced impeachment and probable removal from office, Nixon resigned in August 1974. He was the first US president to resign and did so in disgrace.

Even before they came to power, while based in Yan’an in the early 1940s, the fledgling party, under Mao’s direction, had carried out a purge against intellectuals who did not fall in line with Mao’s directives.1 They were labelled ‘rightists’, and the campaign against them was brutal, involving physical cruelties and mental torture.

Because of its resource endowment India has always been a trading nation. Throughout history India has been most successful and prosperous when it was most connected to the rest of the world. Buddhism spread to the rest of Asia along trade routes between India and west, central, and east Asia, and it was initially a religion of the trading classes, with the guilds and sangha (or monks) working hand in hand.

The phrase the “Great Game” was reputedly coined by British officer Arthur Connolly around 1840, and popularized by Rudyard Kipling. And it led to the British “Forward School” approach to military conquest or annexation of land to ensure security.

He was therefore willing to grant the Soviets equal or greater validity and to work with them. This also accorded with his instinctive faith in socialist solutions to India’s abject socioeconomic condition.

By spring 1951 the Chinese People’s Volunteers, as they were euphemistically called, had outrun their supply lines. Chinese troops in Korea included Mao’s son, Mao Anying, who was killed in November 1950. The following two years of appalling fighting devastated the peninsula, killed 36,568 American troops, about 400,000 Chinese troops, and over 2 million Koreans. Finally, in July 1953, after Stalin’s death on the night of March 1–2, 1953, and with Truman replaced by Eisenhower in January 1953, an armistice was signed, leaving the boundary where it was when the war began.

Mao, always given to conspiracy theories, was fighting to retain political power in the Communist Party after his policies had failed. In this beleaguered state of mind, Mao’s conviction that India sought to detach Tibet from China was further strengthened when the Dalai Lama fled Tibet and entered India on March 31, 1959. The Dalai Lama was granted asylum while being treated as a head of state.

China wanted to negotiate the entire line.17 Zhou did not dispute Nehru’s version of the 1956 talks but laid out the full Chinese claim and repudiated all previous agreements. This was taken in India as Chinese duplicity and proof that India, which had acted in good faith, had been deceived by China.

The United States, working through the World Bank, then exerted considerable effort on the Indus waters dispute, a technical issue more amenable to solutions. The fruit of this effort was the Indus Waters Treaty, brokered by the World Bank and signed in 1960 by Prime Minister Nehru, of India, and President Ayub Khan of Pakistan.

The alacrity with which Pakistan’s ally, the United States, had come to India’s aid prompted Pakistan to secure alternate allies and to benefit from India’s discomfiture. By March 1963 Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement with China, ceding Kashmiri territory in the Shaksgam valley to China. This had its own complications because only in Pakistani-occupied Kashmiri territory does Pakistan share a border with China. The Pakistanis had begun a strategic relationship with China that has grown steadily ever since.

But there remains a feeling in India that India lost at the peace table what she had won in war. In July 1972 Mrs. Gandhi and Bhutto, who had become prime minister of Pakistan, met in Simla to discuss the peace. The Simla Agreement of July 2, 1972, provided for India to vacate all West Pakistan territories occupied during the war and to release all Pakistani prisoners of war. Both sides agreed to redraw and adjust the ceasefire line of 1948 in Kashmir and to call the new line the “Line of Control.”

The internal chaos of the Cultural Revolution (Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution) and turmoil within the People’s Liberation Army after the Lin Biao affair meant that Mao had few or no cards to play. He had asked the four marshals—Chen Yi, Ye Jianying, Xu Xiangqian, and Nie Rongzhen—to study two questions: Who was China’s main enemy and was war likely? In a series of reports from June to September 1969, the marshals answered that the Soviet Union was China’s main enemy and that war with the Soviets was a real possibility. On repeated prodding by Mao and Zhou, they finally suggested that to avoid Soviet harassment China should seek accommodation with the United States and drop its long-standing condition that the United States first withdraw from Taiwan.

That scenario could be seen as a dress rehearsal for U.S.-China economic tensions today.14 The problem was that, like China today, the real Japanese import barriers were structural, and the United States could not point to formal import tariffs or quotas.

Tamil groups were asked to drop their demand for a separate Tamil state (or Eelam), to give up violence and terrorism, and to accept substantial autonomy and devolution in running their own affairs in merged provinces within a united Sri Lanka. Simultaneously the Sri Lankan government was asked to give up its xenophobic ethnic approach and to restructure the polity to meet minority aspirations and isolate extremists.

China had found that despite years of cultivating the Kuomintang (the Chinese Nationalist Party headquartered in Taiwan) and booming trade and investment ties between the mainland and the island of Taiwan, there was a real risk that Lee Teng-hui would be elected the next president of Taiwan. The Kuomintang had so far maintained the fiction that it was the legitimate ruling party of all of China, the Republic of China. However, Lee, who was born on the island, spoke better Japanese than standard Mandarin, and made no secret of his strong Taiwanese identity.

Which leads us back to Brooks. When he tried to figure out why adding more people to a project made it take longer, he discovered two reasons. The first is the time it takes to bring people up to speed. As you’d expect, bringing a new person up to speed slows down everyone else. The second reason has to do not only with how we think but, quite literally, with what our brains are capable of thinking. The number of communication channels increases dramatically with the number of people, and our brains just can’t handle it.

It would leave Pakistan both bankrupt and financially tethered to China. Almost 24 percent of Pakistan’s external debt was already owed to China in 2018,

A popular clamour was growing to have the sentences commuted.

To this day, there is a lot of debate over whether Gandhi did indeed discuss the matter with the viceroy at all. The best available evidence suggests that he briefly raised the matter but did not press it, and there is a possibility that he was subtly misled by the viceroy to believe that the executions were not imminent.

A significant number of Muslim radicals decided to make their way through Afghanistan and Iran to Turkey to fight for the Caliph’s cause. However, after the defeat in the Third Anglo-Afghan War of 1919, the Afghans were not in a position to help them. Kemal Ataturk was in the process of seizing power in Turkey and was also not keen on hosting radicals from India. Thus, they were stranded, destitute and desperate in Afghanistan when Lenin decided to take them in. It appears that Lenin felt that they could be used to destabilize British India and create conditions for a future Soviet expansion. Roy’s training school for Indians in Tashkent was soon dominated by these Islamic radicals. If this Marxist–Islamist mix looked complicated, it became even more so when Enver Pasha, the charismatic wartime leader of Turkey, escaped to Central Asia. Lenin asked Roy to collaborate with Pasha to plan a ‘war of liberation’ in India.

Ironically, this did not happen due to the efforts of M.N. Roy or any Indian communist, but two British communists, Philip Spratt and Benjamin Bradley. With financial support from Moscow, Spratt managed to organize a small number of units before the British arrested several of the activists in 1929. Known as the Meerut Conspiracy Case, the accused were defended by no less than Jawaharlal Nehru and K.N. Katju. The trial went on until 1933, and twenty-seven persons were given sentences of various lengths. More importantly, it provided a great deal of publicity to the communists and created interest in their ideas. Similarly, Roy’s colourful life also attracted a lot of admirers.

Another reason could be that the British had infiltrated the Indian communist movement and felt that they could misdirect its energies (there is some evidence that Yashpal was used for this as well).

In contrast, Bose was unconvinced that the future of the world was so black-and-white or that history would come to a halt at some definite destination. He expressed his doubts as follows: ‘Unless we are at the end of the process of evolution or unless we deny evolution altogether, there is no reason to hold that our choice is restricted to two alternatives.’ He then goes on to speculate that one could even imagine a synthesis between the two.

It took until the rebellions of 1968, the second key event, for Germany’s younger generation to confront their parents about the past. They were no longer prepared to accept silence, half-truths or untruths. They wanted answers about the horror that they knew many older people had taken part in or turned a blind eye to.

Theodor Heuss, West Germany’s first post-war president, declared: ‘We have practically only one chance – and that is work.’ Two politicians were instrumental in Germany’s rapid recovery, for laying the foundations of the Wirtschaftswunder, the Economic Miracle. In 1948, as director of economics under the American and British Bizone, Ludwig Erhard abolished the existing currency overnight. Ten Reichsmarks would be exchanged for one new Deutschmark. Some 90 per cent of public debt was instantly wiped away (as were any private savings in Reichsmarks). Even more daringly, within a week he abolished rationing and price controls which had been introduced by the Nazis, and production limits which had been imposed by the Allies.

The Four Power status of Berlin, agreed upon by the Allied victors, had not included any provisions regarding traffic by land to and from Berlin through the Soviet Zone. It had, however, established three air corridors from the Western Zones to the city. The three Western powers acted swiftly: an airlift of unprecedented dimensions was organized to supply the 2.5 million inhabitants of the Western sectors of Berlin with what they needed to survive.

The protests continued for two years. The flashpoint came in April 1968 when the de facto leader of the student movement, Rudi Dutschke, was shot in the head and wounded by a young anti-communist painter and decorator. Activists blamed the Springer media group for encouraging the assassination attempt. Bild, the main tabloid newspaper, had mounted a campaign against Dutschke, at one point urging readers to ‘eliminate the trouble-makers’.

If you ask any German of that generation, people who are now in their sixties or so, what transformed their understanding of the war, they might offer these three following examples: the first is the Kniefall, the moment when Willy Brandt fell on his knees at the monument to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. The first post-war Social Democrat chancellor was making an official visit to Poland in December 1970 to seal a new era in relations. That year, Germany had declared that its border with Poland on the Oder–Neisse line was final and non-negotiable, renouncing any future claims.

Stoiber’s defeat opened the door for Merkel. Kohl was cast aside. He was deemed such an embarrassment by Merkel and the new team in charge of the CDU that a seventieth birthday gala for him was abruptly cancelled. He grew increasingly embittered. He never forgave Merkel. In 2014, Der Spiegel released tapes in which he told the ghost writer of his autobiography of his rage at her treachery. ‘Mrs Merkel couldn’t even eat properly with a knife and fork. She used to mope around at state dinners, and I often had to set her straight.’8 She quietly endured his taunts, knowing that she had got the better of him. Yet it was a desperately sad end for a giant (in all respects) of a politician.

Mahmud led his first invasion against the Shahiyas of Udbhandapur in AD 1001 when he advanced upon Peshawar. Raja Jayapala was caught unawares, and could not mobilise all his forces in time. The lack of a standing army was to prove the undoing of many Hindu princes in days to come. In contrast, the Muslim militarists always maintained their armed hordes in a permanent state of mobilisation. Even so, the Hindus fought an obstinate battle in the face of overwhelming odds. They, however, depended upon slow moving elephants which proved a poor match for the highly mobile Muslim cavalry. They were defeated and Jayapala himself was made captive.

These Rajput states were Hindu states in consciousness as well as character. They stood firm and spared no sacrifice because they were proud of their ancient Hindu heritage, and looked down with contempt on the barbarism represented by Islam. They failed in the final round only because they could not pursue a forward policy due to their lack of understanding about the nature of Islamic aggression, and in the absence of a central state which could have pooled their resources, maintained a standing army, and updated the art of warfare.

Hindu family and social reform in the sense of the reorganization and reconstruction of the Hindu society. The former has relation to widow remarriage, child marriage, etc., while the latter relates to the abolition of the caste system. The Social Conference was a body which mainly concerned itself with the reform of the high caste Hindu family. It consisted mostly of enlightened high caste Hindus who did not feel the necessity for agitating for the abolition of caste or had not the courage to agitate for it. They felt quite naturally a greater urge to remove such evils as enforced widowhood, child marriages, etc., evils which prevailed among them and which were personally felt by them. They did not stand up for the reform of the Hindu society. The battle that was fought centered round the question of the reform of the family. It did not relate to the social reform in the sense of the break-up of the caste system. It was never put in issue by the reformers. That is the reason why the Social Reform Party lost.

By January 1948, he’d conceptualized a new type of transistor, made up of three chunks of semiconductor material. The outer two chunks would have a surplus of electrons; the piece sandwiched between them would have a deficit. If a tiny current was applied to the middle layer in the sandwich, it set a much larger current flowing across the entire device. This conversion of a small current into a large one was the same amplification process that Brattain and Bardeen’s transistor had demonstrated. But Shockley began to perceive other uses, along the lines of the “solid state valve” he’d previously theorized. He could turn the larger current on and off by manipulating the small current applied to the middle of this transistor sandwich.

The measures passed through the Bundestag in December 2003 and took effect in January 2005. Even now they are a source of heated argument. The package put unemployment and social assistance into a single system; curbed incentives to retire early; and made it easier to employ part-time and contract workers. Most controversially, unemployment benefit was instantly cut to 50 per cent of a worker’s last salary; it had previously been two thirds. It would be paid only up to a maximum of one year, whereas prior to that they could get benefits indefinitely. Even a single failure to turn up to a job centre meeting could lead to a partial loss of money. The slogan was Fördern und Fordern – support people and make demands of them. Schröder, like his friend Tony Blair, was enamoured of global jargon, so the reforms were peppered with ‘Denglisch’ terms like ‘Jobcenter’ and ‘Mini-Job’.

Such traditions are adhered to meticulously and I think there are a number of reasons why: firstly, football aside, Germans feel they cannot rally around national celebrations.

Dialects vary and food and drink and customs do, too, and celebrating them is an important part of local pride. Thirdly, there is the sense that Werner Abelshauser’s argument about the importance of community over the individual really does hold in Germany.

Rather than use a separate piece of silicon or germanium to build each transistor, he thought of assembling multiple components on the same piece of semiconductor material. When his colleagues returned from summer vacation, they realized that Kilby’s idea was revolutionary. Multiple transistors could be built into a single slab of silicon or germanium. Kilby called his invention an “integrated circuit,” but it became known colloquially as a “chip,” because each integrated circuit was made from a piece of silicon “chipped” off a circular silicon wafer.

If so, by 1975, integrated circuits would have sixty-five thousand tiny transistors carved into them, creating not only more computing power but also lower prices per transistor. As costs fell, the number of users would grow. This forecast of exponential growth in computing power soon came to be known as Moore’s Law. It was the greatest technological prediction of the century.

Weber searched for the pattern of institutions and beliefs that had made Europe ‘different’. Capitalism had developed in other parts of Eurasia, but Europe alone had made the transition to modern industrial capitalism, and the world pre-eminence that this had brought with it. At the heart of Weber’s explanation was the idea that modern capitalism required above all an activist, rationalizing mentality. Chinese Confucianism (rational but inactive), Islam (active but irrational) and Hinduism (inactive and irrational) all discouraged the vital combination.

Before the 1970s, computers generally “remembered” data using not silicon chips but a device called a magnetic core, a matrix of tiny metal rings strung together by a grid of wires. When a ring was magnetized, it stored a 1 for the computer; a non-magnetized ring was a 0. The jungle of wires that strung the rings together could turn each ring’s magnetism off and on and could “read” whether a given ring was a 1 or a 0.

contrast, the other main type of chips—those tasked with “computing” rather than “remembering”—were specially designed for each device, because every computing problem was different. A calculator worked differently than a missile’s guidance computer, for example, so until the 1970s, they used different types of logic chips. This specialization drove up cost, so Intel decided to focus on memory chips, where mass production would produce economies of scale.

From the first Fairchild assembly plant on Hong Kong’s Kowloon Bay, integrated circuits had been an integral feature of America’s position in Asia. U.S. chipmakers built facilities from Taiwan to South Korea to Singapore. These territories were defended from Communist incursions not only by military force but also by economic integration, as the electronics industry sucked the region’s peasants off farms—where rural poverty often inspired guerilla opposition—into good jobs assembling electronic devices for American consumption.

Yet Samsung’s all-in bet on chips wouldn’t have worked without support from Silicon Valley. The best way to deal with international competition in memory chips from Japan, Silicon Valley wagered, was to find an even cheaper source in Korea, while focusing America’s R&D efforts on higher-value products rather than commoditized DRAMs. U.S. chipmakers therefore saw Korean upstarts as potential partners. “With the Koreans around,” Bob Noyce told Andy Grove, Japan’s strategy of “dump no matter what the costs” wouldn’t succeed in monopolizing the world’s DRAM production, because the Koreans would undercut Japanese producers. The result would be “deadly” to Japanese chipmakers, Noyce predicted.

Sony, which was unique among Japanese semiconductor firms in never betting heavily on DRAMs, succeeded in developing innovative new products, like specialized chips for image sensors. When photons strike their silicon, these chips create electric charges that are correlated to the strength of the light, letting the chips convert images into digital data. Sony was therefore well placed to lead the digital camera revolution, and the company’s chips that sense images today remain world-class.

Before TSMC, a couple of small companies, mostly based in Silicon Valley, had tried building businesses around chip design, avoiding the cost of building their own fabs by outsourcing the manufacturing. These “fabless” firms were sometimes able to convince a bigger chipmaker with spare capacity to manufacture their chips. However, they always had second-class status behind the bigger chipmakers’ own production plans. Worse, they faced the constant risk that their manufacturing partners would steal their ideas. In addition, they had to navigate manufacturing processes that were slightly different at each big chipmaker. Not having to build fabs dramatically reduced startup costs, but counting on competitors to manufacture chips was always a risky business model.

Were it not for Communist rule, China might have played a much larger role in the semiconductor industry. When the integrated circuit was invented, China had many of the ingredients that helped Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea attract American semiconductor investment, like a vast, low-cost workforce and a well-educated scientific elite. However, after seizing power in 1949, the Communists looked at foreign connections with suspicion. For someone like Morris Chang, returning to China after finishing his studies at Stanford would have meant certain poverty and possible imprisonment or death.

In the early days of chipmaking, transistors were so big that the size of the light waves used by lithography tools barely mattered. But Moore’s Law had progressed to the point where the scale of light waves—a couple hundred nanometers, depending on the color—impacted the precision with which circuits could be etched. By the 1990s, the most advanced transistors were measured in the hundreds of nanometers (billionths of a meter), but it was already possible to envision far smaller transistors with features just a dozen nanometers in length.

ASML’s second strength, unexpectedly, was its location in the Netherlands. In the 1980s and 1990s, the company was seen as neutral in the trade disputes between Japan and the United States. U.S. firms treated it like a trustworthy alternative to Nikon and Canon. For example, when Micron, the American DRAM startup, wanted to buy lithography tools, it turned to ASML rather than relying on one of the two main Japanese suppliers, each of which had deep ties with Micron’s DRAM competitors in Japan.

This third category has not been primarily dependent on Moore’s Law to drive performance improvements. Clever design matters more than shrinking transistors. Today around three-quarters of this category of chips are produced on processors at or larger than 180 nanometers, a manufacturing technology that was pioneered in the late 1990s. As a result, the economics of this segment are different from logic and memory chips that must relentlessly shrink transistors to remain on the cutting edge. Fabs for these types of chips generally don’t need to race toward the smallest transistors every couple of years, so they’re substantially cheaper, on average requiring a quarter the capital investment of an advanced fab for logic or memory chips. Today, the biggest analog chipmakers are American, European, or Japanese. Most of their production occurs in these three regions, too, with only a sliver offshored to Taiwan and South Korea. The largest analog chipmaker today is Texas Instruments, which failed to establish an Intel-style monopoly in the PC, data center, or smartphone ecosystems but remains a medium-sized, highly profitable chipmaker with a vast catalog of analog chips and sensors. There are many other U.S.-based analog chipmakers now, like Onsemi, Skyworks, and Analog Devices, alongside comparable companies in Europe and Japan.

Computer graphics remained an appealing niche for semiconductor startups, because unlike PC microprocessors, in graphics Intel didn’t have a de facto monopoly. Every PC maker, from IBM to Compaq, had to use an Intel or an AMD chip for their main processor, because these two firms had a de facto monopoly on the x86 instruction set that PCs required. There was a lot more competition in the market for chips that rendered images on screens. The emergence of semiconductor foundries, and the driving down of startup costs, meant that it wasn’t only Silicon Valley aristocracy that could compete to build the best graphics processors.

Nvidia not only designed chips called graphics processor units (GPUs) capable of handling 3D graphics, it also devised a software ecosystem around them. Making realistic graphics requires use of programs called shaders, which tell all the pixels in an image how they should be portrayed in, say, a given shade of light. The shader is applied to each of the pixels in an image, a relatively straightforward calculation conducted over many thousands of pixels.

Jacobs, whose faith in Moore’s Law was as strong as ever, thought a more complicated system of frequency-hopping would work better. Rather than keeping a given phone call on a certain frequency, he proposed moving call data between different frequencies, letting him cram more calls into available spectrum space. Most people thought he was right in theory, but that such a system would never work in practice. Voice quality would be low, they argued, and calls would be dropped. The amount of processing needed to move call data between frequencies and have it interpreted by a phone on the other end seemed enormous. Jacobs disagreed, founding a company called Qualcomm—Quality Communications—in 1985 to prove the point. He built a small network with a couple cell towers to prove it would work. Soon the entire industry realized Qualcomm’s system would make it possible to fit far more cell phone calls into existing spectrum space by relying on Moore’s Law to run the algorithms that make sense of all the radio waves bouncing around. For each generation of cell phone technology after 2G, Qualcomm contributed key ideas about how to transmit more data via the radio spectrum and sold specialized chips with the computing power capable of deciphering this cacophony of signals.

Five years after Sanders retired from AMD, the company announced it was dividing its chip design and fabrication businesses. Wall Street cheered, reckoning the new AMD would be more profitable without the capital-intensive fabs. AMD spun out these facilities into a new company that would operate as a foundry like TSMC, producing chips not only for AMD but other customers, too. The investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government, Mubadala, became the primary investor in the new foundry, an unexpected position for a country known more for hydrocarbons than for high-tech. CFIUS, the U.S. government body that reviews foreign purchases of strategic assets, waved the sale through, judging that it had no national security implications.

For many years, each generation of manufacturing technology was named after the length of the transistor’s gate, the part of the silicon chip whose conductivity would be turned on and off, creating and interrupting the circuit. The 180nm node was pioneered in 1999, followed by 130nm, 90nm, 65nm, and 45nm, with each generation shrinking transistors enough to make it possible to cram roughly twice as many in the same area. This reduced power consumption per transistor, because smaller transistors needed fewer electrons to flow through them.

Around the early 2010s, it became unfeasible to pack transistors more densely by shrinking them two dimensionally. One challenge was that, as transistors were shrunk according to Moore’s Law, the narrow length of the conductor channel occasionally caused power to “leak” through the circuit even when the switch was off. On top of this, the layer of silicon dioxide atop each transistor became so thin that quantum effects like “tunneling”—jumping through barriers that classical physics said should be insurmountable—began seriously impacting transistor performance.

To better control the movement of electrons, new materials and transistor designs were needed. Unlike the 2D design used since the 1960s, the 22nm node introduced a new 3D transistor, called a FinFET (pronounced finfet), that sets the two ends of the circuit and the channel of semiconductor material that connects them on top of a block, looking like a fin protruding from a whale’s back. The channel that connects the two ends of the circuit can therefore have an electric field applied not only from the top but also from the sides of the fin, enhancing control over the electrons and overcoming the electricity leakage that was threatening the performance of new generations of tiny transistors. These nanometer-scale 3D structures were crucial for the survival of Moore’s Law, but they were staggeringly difficult to make, requiring even more precision in deposition, etching, and lithography.

The concept remained much the same as Jay Lathrop’s upside-down microscope: create a pattern of light waves by using a “mask” to block some of the light, then project the light onto photoresist chemicals applied to a silicon wafer. The light reacts with photoresists, making it possible to deposit material or etch it away in perfectly formed shapes, producing a working chip.

This required a carbon dioxide−based laser more powerful than any that previously existed. In summer 2005, two engineers at Cymer approached a German precision tooling company called Trumpf to see if it could build such a laser. Trumpf already made the world’s best carbon dioxide−based lasers for industrial uses like precision cutting. These lasers were monuments of machining in the best German industrial tradition. Because around 80 percent of the energy a carbon dioxide laser produces is heat and only 20 percent light, extracting heat from the machine is a key challenge.

Cymer demanded was more exacting than anything Trumpf had previously dealt with. The company proposed a laser with four components: two “seed” lasers that are low power but accurately time each pulse so that the laser can hit 50 million tin drops a second; four resonators that increase the beam’s power; an ultra-accurate “beam transport system” that directs the beam over thirty meters toward the tin droplet chamber; and a final focusing device to ensure the laser scores a direct hit, millions of times a second.

After Cymer and Trumpf found a way to blast tin so it emits sufficient EUV light, the next step was to create mirrors that collected the light and directed it toward a silicon chip. Zeiss, the German company that builds the world’s most advanced optical systems, had built mirrors and lenses for lithography systems since the days of Perkin Elmer and GCA. The difference between the optics used in the past and those required by EUV, however, was about as vast as the contrast between Lathrop’s lightbulb and Cymer’s system of blasting tin droplets.

Chip firms simply can’t ignore the world’s largest market for semiconductors. Chipmakers jealously guard their critical technologies, of course. But almost every chip firm has non-core technology, in subsectors that they don’t lead, that they’d be happy to share for a price. When companies are losing market share or in need of financing, moreover, they don’t have the luxury of focusing on the long term. This gives China powerful levers to induce foreign chip firms to transfer technology, open production facilities, or license intellectual property, even when foreign companies realize they’re helping develop competitors

He bought a 25 percent stake in Taiwan’s Powertech Technology, which assembles and tests semiconductors, a transaction that was allowed under Taiwan’s rules. He pursued stakes and joint ventures with several of Taiwan’s other large chip assemblers. However, Zhao’s real interest was in buying the island’s crown jewels—MediaTek, the leading chip designer outside the U.S., and TSMC, the foundry on which almost all the world’s fabless chip firms rely.

Jinhua cut a deal with Taiwan’s UMC, which fabricated logic chips (not memory chips), whereby UMC would receive around $700 million in exchange for providing expertise in producing DRAM. Licensing agreements are common in the semiconductor industry, but this agreement had a twist. UMC was promising to provide DRAM technology, but it wasn’t in the DRAM business. So in September 2015, UMC hired multiple employees from Micron’s facility in Taiwan, starting with the president, Steven Chen, who was put in charge of developing UMC’s DRAM technology and managing its relationship with Jinhua. The next month, UMC hired a process manager at Micron’s Taiwan facility named J. T. Ho. Over the subsequent year, Ho received a series of documents from his former Micron colleague, Kenny Wang, who was still working at the Idaho chipmaker’s facility in Taiwan. Eventually, Wang left Micron to move to UMC, bringing nine hundred files uploaded to Google Drive with him.

One might have expected the offshoring of chipmaking to have reduced the U.S. government’s ability to restrict access to advanced chip fabrication. It would certainly have been easier to cut off Huawei if all the world’s advanced chipmaking was still based on U.S. soil. However, the U.S. still had cards to play. For example, the process of offshoring chip fabrication had coincided with a growing monopolization of chip industry choke points. Nearly every chip in the world uses software from at least one of three U.S.-based companies, Cadence, Synopsys, and Mentor (the latter of which is owned by Germany’s Siemens but based in Oregon). Excluding the chips Intel builds in-house, all the most advanced logic chips are fabricated by just two companies, Samsung and TSMC, both located in countries that rely on the U.S. military for their security. Moreover, making advanced processors requires EUV lithography machines produced by just one company, the Netherlands’ ASML, which in turn relies on its San Diego subsidiary, Cymer (which it purchased in 2013), to supply the irreplaceable light sources in its EUV lithography tools.

It was at one time recognized that without social efficiency, no permanent progress in the other fields of activity was possible, that owing to mischief wrought by the evil customs, Hindu society was not in a state of efficiency and that ceaseless efforts must be made to eradicate these evils. It was due to the recognition of this fact that the birth of the National Congress was accompanied by the foundation of the Social Conference. While the Congress was concerned with defining the weak points in the political organisation of the country, the Social Conference was engaged in removing the weak points in the social organisation of the Hindu society. For some time, the Congress and the Conference worked as two wings of one common activity and they held their annual sessions in the same pandal.

The point at issue was whether social reform should precede political reform. For a decade, the forces were evenly balanced and the battle was fought without victory to either side. It was, however, evident that the fortunes of the Social Conference were ebbing fast. The gentlemen who presided over the sessions of the Social Conference lamented that the majority of the educated Hindus were for political advancement and indifferent to social reform; and that while the number of those who attended the Congress was very large, and the number who did not attend but who sympathized with it even larger, the number of those who attended the Social Conference was very much smaller. This indifference, this thinning of its ranks was soon followed by active hostility from the politicians.

Think back to the notion of the Marginal Decade and Bonus Decade that we introduced in chapter 3, and the graph of lifespan versus healthspan. Because Medicine 2.0 often drags out lifespan in the context of low health span, it lengthens the window of morbidity, the period of disease and disability at the end of life. People are sicker for longer before they die. Their Marginal Decade is spent largely as a patient. When centenarians die, in contrast, they have generally (though not always) been sick and/or disabled for a much shorter period of time than people who die two or three decades earlier. This is called compression of morbidity, and it basically means shrinking or shortening the period of decline at the end of life and lengthening the period of healthy life, or healthspan.

Ultimately, he and others discovered1 that rapamycin acted directly on a very important intracellular protein complex called mTOR (pronounced “em-tor”), for “mechanistic target of rapamycin.”fn2 Why do we care about mTOR? Because this mechanism turns out to be one of the most important mediators of longevity at the cellular level. Not only that, but it is highly “conserved,”2 meaning it is found in virtually all forms of life, ranging from yeast to flies to worms and right on up to us humans. In biology, “conserved” means that something has been passed on via natural selection, across multiple species and classes of organisms—a sign that evolution has deemed it to be very important.

The job of mTOR3 is basically to balance an organism’s need to grow and reproduce against the availability of nutrients. When food is plentiful, mTOR is activated and the cell (or the organism) goes into growth mode, producing new proteins and undergoing cell division, as with the ultimate goal of reproduction. When nutrients are scarce, mTOR is suppressed and cells go into a kind of “recycling” mode, breaking down cellular components and generally cleaning house.

CR studies have helped to uncover critical cellular mechanisms related to nutrients and longevity. Reducing the amount of nutrients available to a cell seems to trigger a group of innate pathways that enhance the cell’s stress resistance and metabolic efficiency—all of them related, in some way, to mTOR.

The first of these is an enzyme called AMP-activated protein kinase, or AMPK for short. AMPK is like the low-fuel light on the dashboard of your car: when it senses low levels of nutrients14 (fuel), it activates, triggering a cascade of actions. While this typically happens as a response to lack of nutrients, AMPK is also activated when we exercise, responding to the transient drop in nutrient levels. Just as you would change your itinerary if your fuel light came on, heading for the nearest gas station rather than Grandma’s house, AMPK prompts the cell to conserve and seek alternative sources of energy.

It does this first by stimulating the production of new mitochondria, the tiny organelles that produce energy in the cell, via a process called mitochondrial biogenesis. Over time—or with disuse—our mitochondria become vulnerable to oxidative stress and genomic damage, leading to dysfunction and failure. Restricting the amount of nutrients that are available, via dietary restriction or exercise, triggers the production of newer, more efficient mitochondria to replace old and damaged ones. These fresh mitochondria help the cell produce more ATP, the cellular energy currency, with the fuel it does have. AMPK also prompts the body to provide more fuel for these new mitochondria, by producing glucose in the liver (which we’ll talk about in the next chapter) and releasing energy stored in fat cells.

More importantly, AMPK works to inhibit the activity of mTOR, the cellular growth regulator. Specifically, it seems to be a drop in amino acids that induces mTOR to shut down, and with it all the anabolic (growth) processes that mTOR controls. Instead of making new proteins and undergoing cell division, the cell goes into a more fuel-efficient and stress-resistant mode, activating an important cellular recycling process called autophagy, which means “self-eating” (or better yet, “self-devouring”).

Autophagy represents the catabolic side of metabolism, when the cell stops producing new proteins and instead begins to break down old proteins and other cellular structures into their amino acid components, using the scavenged materials to build new ones. It’s a form of cellular recycling, cleaning out the accumulated junk in the cell and repurposing it or disposing of it.

Except instead of trash bags, this cellular cleanup is carried out by specialized organelles called lysosomes, which package up the old proteins and other detritus, including pathogens, and grind them down (via enzymes) for reuse. In addition, the lysosomes also break up and destroy things called aggregates, which are clumps of damaged proteins that accumulate over time.

By cleansing our cells of damaged proteins and other cellular junk, autophagy allows cells to run more cleanly and efficiently and helps make them more resistant to stress. But as we get older, autophagy declines. Impaired autophagy is thought to be an important driver of numerous aging-related phenotypes and ailments, such as neurodegeneration and osteoarthritis. Thus, I find it fascinating that this very important cellular mechanism can be triggered by certain kinds of interventions, such as a temporary reduction in nutrients (as when we are exercising or fasting)—and the drug rapamycin.

The first signs would generally show up only on a blood test for the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT for short). Rising levels of ALT are often the first clue that something is wrong with the liver, although they could also be a symptom of something else, such as a recent viral infection or a reaction to a medication. But there are many people walking around whose physicians have no idea that they are in the early stages of this disease, because their ALT levels are still “normal.”

If you eat a doughnut, for example, the body has to decide what to do with the calories in that doughnut. At the risk of oversimplifying a bit, the carbohydrate from our doughnut has two possible fates. First, it can be converted into glycogen, the storage form of glucose, suitable for use in the near term. About 75 percent of this glycogen ends up in skeletal muscle and the other 25 percent goes to the liver, although this ratio can vary. An adult male can typically store a total of about 1,600 calories worth of glycogen between these two sites, or about enough energy for two hours of vigorous endurance exercise.

One of the liver’s many important jobs is to convert this stored glycogen back to glucose and then to release it as needed to maintain blood glucose levels at a steady state, known as glucose homeostasis. This is an incredibly delicate task: an average adult male will have about five grams of glucose circulating in his bloodstream at any given time, or about a teaspoon. That teaspoon won’t last more than a few minutes, as glucose is taken up by the muscles and especially the brain, so the liver has to continually feed in more, titrating it precisely to maintain a more or less constant level. Consider that five grams of glucose, spread out across one’s entire circulatory system, is normal, while seven grams—a teaspoon and a half—means you have diabetes. As I said, the liver is an amazing organ.

That decision—where to put the energy from the doughnut—is made via hormones, chief among them insulin, which is secreted by the pancreas when the body senses the presence of glucose, the final breakdown product of most carbohydrates (such as those in the doughnut).

Insulin resistance is a term that we hear a lot, but what does it really mean? Technically, it means that cells, initially muscle cells, have stopped listening to insulin’s signals, but another way to visualize it is to imagine the cell as a balloon being blown up with air. Eventually, the balloon expands to the point where it gets more difficult to force more air inside. You have to blow harder and harder. This is where insulin comes in, to help facilitate the process of blowing air into the balloon. The pancreas begins to secrete even more insulin, to try to remove excess glucose from the bloodstream and cram it into cells. For the time being it works, and blood glucose levels remain normal, but eventually you reach a limit where the “balloon” (cells) cannot accept any more “air” (glucose). This is when the trouble shows up on a standard blood test, as fasting blood glucose begins to rise. This means you have high insulin levels and high blood glucose, and your cells are shutting the gates to glucose entry. If things continue in this way, then the pancreas becomes fatigued and less able to mount an insulin response. This is made worse by, you guessed it, the fat now residing in the pancreas itself.

Cortisol is especially potent, with a double-edged effect of depleting subcutaneous fat (which is generally beneficial) and replacing it with more harmful visceral fat. This is one reason why stress levels and sleep, both of which affect cortisol release, are pertinent to metabolism. But insulin seems to be the most potent17 as far as promoting fat accumulation because it acts as kind of a one-way gate, allowing fat to enter the cell while impairing the release of energy from fat cells (via a process called lipolysis). Insulin is all about fat storage, not fat utilization.

Another issue is that glucose and fructose are metabolized very differently at the cellular level. When a brain cell, muscle cell, gut cell, or any other type of cell breaks down glucose, it will almost instantly have more ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cellular energy “currency,” at its disposal. But this energy is not free: the cell must expend a small amount of ATP in order to make more ATP, in the same way that you sometimes have to spend money to make money. In glucose metabolism, this energy expenditure is regulated by a specific enzyme that prevents the cell from “spending” too much of its ATP on metabolism. But when we metabolize fructose in large quantities, a different enzyme takes over, and this enzyme does not put the brakes on ATP “spending.”28 Instead, energy (ATP) levels inside the cell drop rapidly and dramatically. This rapid drop in energy levels makes the cell think that we are still hungry. The mechanisms are a bit complicated, but the bottom line is that even though it is rich in energy, fructose basically tricks our metabolism into thinking that we are depleting energy—and need to take in still more food and store more energy as fat.

On a more macro level, consuming large quantities of liquid fructose simply overwhelms the ability of the gut to handle it; the excess is shunted to the liver, where many of those calories are likely to end up as fat. I’ve seen patients work themselves into NAFLD by drinking too many “healthy” fruit smoothies, for the same reason: they are taking in too much fructose, too quickly. Thus, the almost infinite availability of liquid fructose in our already high-calorie modern diet sets us up for metabolic failure if we’re not careful (and especially if we are not physically active).

A handful of genes emerged as drivers, including TP53 (also known as p53, found in half of all cancers), KRAS (common in pancreatic cancer), PIC3A (common in breast cancer), and BRAF (common in melanoma), but very few if any of these well-known mutations were shared across all tumors. In fact, there didn’t seem to be any individual genes that “caused” cancer at all; instead, it seemed to be random somatic mutations that combined to cause cancers.

So when you hear the sad story of someone dying from breast or prostate cancer, or even pancreatic or colon cancer, they died because the cancer spread to other, more critical organs such as the brain, the lungs, the liver, and bones. When cancer reaches those places, survival rates drop precipitously

These drugs attack the replicative cycle of cells, and because cancer cells are rapidly dividing, the chemo agents harm them more severely than normal cells. But many important noncancerous cells are also dividing frequently, such as those in the lining of the mouth and gut, the hair follicles, and the nails, which is why typical chemotherapy agents cause side effects like hair loss and gastrointestinal misery.

The first such hallmark is the fact that many cancer cells have an altered metabolism, consuming huge amounts of glucose. Second, cancer cells seem to have an uncanny ability to evade the immune system, which normally hunts down damaged and dangerous cells—such as cancerous cells—and targets them for destruction.

But these cancer cells weren’t “respiring” the way normal cells do, consuming oxygen and producing lots of ATP, the energy currency of the cell, via the mitochondria. Rather, they appeared to be using a different pathway that cells normally use to produce energy under anaerobic conditions, meaning without sufficient oxygen, such as when we are sprinting.

In normal aerobic respiration, a cell can turn one molecule of glucose into as many as thirty-six units of ATP. But under anaerobic conditions, that same amount of glucose yields only two net units of ATP. This phenomenon was dubbed the Warburg effect,11 and even today, one way to locate potential tumors is by injecting the patient with radioactively labeled glucose and then doing a PET scan to see where most of the glucose is migrating. Areas with abnormally high glucose concentrations indicate the possible presence of a tumor.

While it may not yield much in the way of energy, they found, the Warburg effect generates lots of by-products, such as lactate, a substance that is also produced during intense exercise. In fact, turning glucose into lactate creates so many extra molecules that the authors argued that the relatively small amount of energy it produces may actually be the “by-product.”

There’s a logic to this seeming madness: when a cell divides, it doesn’t simply split into two smaller cells. The process requires not only the division of the nucleus, and all that stuff we learned in high school biology, but the actual physical materials required to construct a whole new cell. Those don’t just appear out of nowhere. Normal aerobic cellular respiration produces only energy, in the form of ATP, plus water and carbon dioxide, which aren’t much use as building materials (also, we exhale the latter two). The Warburg effect, also known as anaerobic glycolysis, turns the same amount of glucose into a little bit of energy and a whole lot of chemical building blocks—which are then used to build new cells rapidly. Thus, the Warburg effect is how cancer cells fuel their own proliferation. But it also represents a potential vulnerability in cancer’s armor.

I suspect that the association between obesity, diabetes, and cancer is primarily driven by inflammation and growth factors such as insulin. Obesity, especially when accompanied by accumulation of visceral fat (and other fat outside of subcutaneous storage depots), helps promote inflammation, as dying fat cells secrete an array of inflammatory cytokines into the circulation (see figure 4 in chapter 6). This chronic inflammation helps create an environment that could induce cells to become cancerous. It also contributes to the development of insulin resistance, causing insulin levels to creep upwards—and, as we’ll see shortly, insulin itself is a bad actor in cancer metabolism.

PI3K, that play a major role in fueling the Warburg effect by speeding up glucose uptake into the cell. In effect, PI3K helps to open a gate in the cell wall, allowing glucose to flood in to fuel its growth. Cancer cells possess specific mutations that turn up PI3K activity while shutting down the tumor-suppressing protein PTEN, which we talked about earlier in this chapter. When PI3K is activated by insulin and IGF-1, the insulin-like growth factor, the cell is able to devour glucose at a great rate to fuel its growth. Thus, insulin acts as a kind of cancer enabler, accelerating its growth.

the problem with PI3K inhibitors, he explained, is that by turning down the insulin-related PI3K pathway, they actually end up raising insulin and glucose levels. Because glucose is blocked from entering the cell, more of it stays in the bloodstream. The body then thinks it needs to produce more insulin to get rid of all that glucose, possibly negating some of the effects of the drug by activating PI3K. So what if we combined PI3K inhibitors with an insulin-minimizing or ketogenic diet?

best strategy to target cancer is likely by targeting multiple vulnerabilities of the disease at one time, or in sequence. By stacking different therapies, such as combining a PI3K inhibitor with a ketogenic diet, we can attack cancer on multiple fronts, while also minimizing the likelihood of the cancer developing resistance (via mutations) to any single treatment.

As elegant as they are, however, CAR-T treatments have proven successful only against one specific type of cancer called B-cell lymphoma. All B-cells, normal and cancerous alike, express a protein called CD19, which is the target used by the CAR-T cell to zero in and kill them. Since we can live without B-cells, CAR-T works by obliterating all CD19-bearing cells. Unfortunately, we have not yet identified a similar marker for other cancers.

James Allison, who has been working on immunotherapy for almost as long as Steve Rosenberg, figured out how cancer cells hide from the immune system by exploiting so-called checkpoints that are normally supposed to regulate our T cells and keep them from going overboard and attacking our normal cells, which would lead to autoimmune disease. Essentially, the checkpoints ask the T cells, one last time, “Are you sure you want to kill this cell?”

There are two ways to do ACT. First, we can take a sample of a patient’s tumor and isolate those T cells that do recognize the tumor as a threat. These are called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), but there may only be a few million of them, not enough to mount a complete response against the tumor. By removing the TILs from the body and multiplying them by a factor of 1,000 or so, and then reinfusing them into the patient, we can expect to see a much better response. Alternatively, T cells can be harvested from the patient’s blood and genetically modified to recognize his or her specific tumor. Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages,fn4 but the interesting part is that ACT effectively means designing a new, customized anticancer drug for each individual patient.

The Grail test, known as Galleri, looks at methylation patterns of the cell-free DNA, which are basically chemical changes to the DNA molecules that suggest the presence of cancer. Using very-high-throughput screening and a massive AI engine, the Galleri test can glean two crucial pieces of information from this sample of blood: Is cancer present? And if so, where is it? From what part of the body did it most likely originate? With any diagnostic test, a decision has to be made with respect to how to calibrate, or tune, it. Is it going to be geared toward higher sensitivity or higher specificity? Galleri has been validated33 against a database called the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (CCGA), which is based on blood samples from more than fifteen thousand patients both with and without cancer.

Because it is often found at the scene of the crime, amyloid-beta was immediately suspected to be a primary cause of Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloid-beta is a by-product that is created when a normally occurring substance called amyloid precursor protein, or APP, a membrane protein that is found in neuronal synapses, is cleaved into three pieces. Normally, APP is split into two pieces, and everything is fine. But when APP is cut in thirds, one of the resulting fragments then becomes “misfolded,” meaning it loses its normal structure (and thus its function) and becomes chemically stickier, prone to aggregating in clumps. This is amyloid-beta, and it is clearly bad stuff.

Just as Alzheimer’s disease is defined (rightly or wrongly) by accumulations of amyloid and tau, Lewy body dementia and Parkinson’s disease are associated with the accumulation of a neurotoxic protein called alpha-synuclein, which builds up in aggregates known as Lewy bodies (first observed by a colleague of Alois Alzheimer’s named Friedrich Lewy). The APOE e4 variant not only increases someone’s risk for Alzheimer’s but also significantly raises their risk of Lewy body dementia as well as9 Parkinson’s disease with dementia, further supporting the notion that these conditions are related on some level.

On top of this, brain cells metabolize glucose in a different way from the rest of the body; they do not depend on insulin, instead absorbing circulating glucose directly, via transporters that essentially open a gate in the cell membrane. This enables the brain to take top priority to fuel itself when blood glucose levels are low. If we lack new sources of glucose, the brain’s preferred fuel, the liver converts our fat into ketone bodies, as an alternative energy source that can sustain us for a very long time, depending on the extent of our fat stores.

VO2 max represents the maximum rate at which a person can utilize oxygen. This is measured, naturally, while a person is exercising at essentially their upper limit of effort. (If you’ve ever had this test done, you will know just how unpleasant it is.) The more oxygen your body is able to use, the higher your VO2 max.

At this level of intensity, someone my size might require 2,500 to 3,000 ml of oxygen per minute, an eight-to tenfold increase from when I was sitting on the couch. Now, if I start running up a hill as fast as I can, my body’s oxygen demand will increase from there: 4,000 ml, 4,500 ml, even 5,000 ml or more depending on the pace and my fitness level. The fitter I am, the more oxygen I can consume to make ATP, and the faster I can run up that hill.

VO2 max is typically expressed in terms of the volume of oxygen a person can use, per kilogram of body weight, per minute. An average forty-five-year-old man will have a VO2 max around 40 ml/kg/min, while an elite endurance athlete will likely score in the high 60s and above.

This study found that someone of below-average VO2 max for their age and sex (that is, between the 25th and 50th percentiles) is at double the risk of all-cause mortality compared to someone in the top quartile (75th to 97.6th percentiles). Thus, poor cardiorespiratory fitness carries a greater relative risk of death than smoking.

exercise strengthens the heart and helps maintain the circulatory system. As we’ll see later in this chapter, it also improves the health of the mitochondria, the crucial little organelles that produce energy in our cells (among other things). That, in turn, improves our ability to metabolize both glucose and fat. Having more muscle mass and stronger muscles helps support and protect the body—and also maintains metabolic health, because those muscles consume energy efficiently.

Typically, zone 1 is a walk in the park and zone 5 (or 6, or 7) is an all-out sprint. Zone 2 is more or less the same in all training models: going at a speed slow enough that one can still maintain a conversation but fast enough that the conversation might be a little strained.

The other reason is that he believes it plays a crucial role in preventing chronic disease by improving the health and efficiency of your mitochondria, which is why training aerobic endurance and efficiency (i.e., zone 2 work) is the first element of my Centenarian Decathlon training program. When we are exercising in zone 2, most of the work is being done by our type 1, or “slow-twitch,” muscle fibers. These are extremely dense with mitochondria and thus well-suited for slow-paced, efficient endurance work. We can go for a long time without feeling fatigued. If we pick up the pace, we begin to recruit more type 2 (“fast-twitch”) muscle fibers, which are less efficient but more forceful. They also generate more lactate in the process, because of the way they create ATP. Lactate itself is not bad; trained athletes are able to recycle it as a type of fuel. The problem is that lactate becomes lactic acid when paired with hydrogen ions, which is what causes that acute burning you feel in your musclesfn1 during a hard effort.

If you know your maximum heart rate—not estimated, but your actual maximum, the highest number you’ve ever seen on a heart rate monitor—your zone 2 will correspond to between approximately 70 and 85 percent of that peak number, depending on your fitness levels. That’s a big range, so when starting people out, I prefer they rely on their rate of perceived exertion, or RPE, also known as the “talk test.”

This pronounced difference comes back to the fact that the unhealthy subjects’ mitochondria—their engine(s)—were much less efficient than those of the athletes, so they very quickly switched over from aerobic respiration, burning fat and glucose in the mitochondria with oxygen, to the much less efficient glycolysis, an energy-producing pathway that consumes only glucose and produces loads of lactate (similar to the way cancer cells produce energy, via the Warburg effect). Once we start producing energy this way, lactate accumulates and our effort quickly becomes unsustainable.

Both poor sleep and high stress activate the sympathetic nervous system, which—despite its name—is the opposite of calming. It is part of our fight-or-flight response, prompting the release of hormones called glucocorticoids, including the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol raises blood pressure; it also causes glucose to be released25 from the liver, while inhibiting the uptake and utilization of glucose in the muscle and fat tissues, perhaps in order to prioritize glucose delivery to the brain. In the body, this manifests as elevated glucose due to stress-induced insulin resistance. I see this often, in myself and some of my patients: high overnight glucose on CGM is almost always a sign of excessive cortisol, sometimes exacerbated by late-night eating and drinking.

Deep sleep, on the other hand, seems to be essential to the very health of our brain as an organ. A few years ago, researchers in Rochester42 discovered that while we are in deep sleep, the brain activates a kind of internal waste disposal system that allows cerebrospinal fluid to flood in between the neurons and sweep away intercellular junk; while this happens, the neurons themselves pull back to allow this to happen, the way city residents are sometimes required to move their cars to allow street sweepers to pass through. This cleansing process flushes out detritus, including both amyloid-beta and tau, the two proteins43 linked to neurodegeneration. But if we do not spend enough time in deep sleep, the system cannot work as effectively, and amyloid and tau build up among the neurons. Broader studies have found44 that people who have generally slept less than seven hours per night, over decades, tend to have much more amyloid-beta and tau built up in their brains than people who sleep for seven hours or more per night. Tau, the protein that collects in “tangles” inside unhealthy neurons, is itself correlated to sleep disturbances in cognitively normal people and in those with MCI, or mild cognitive impairment, an early stage of dementia.

This was a clear departure from the established norms. His concerns were adequately outlined in the budget 2003–04. In his second stint as the chief minister, he launched a pioneering move in power reforms, ‘Jyoti Gram Yojana’, which became a model for the rest of the country. Under this scheme, round-the-clock power supply of one-phase electricity for domestic consumption was assured to each household after the bifurcation of feeders for domestic and agricultural/industrial consumption. Since electricity for agricultural purpose is heavily subsidized, it is often used for domestic consumption. The bifurcation of feeders enabled power companies to raise the bill according to the user’s actual consumption. Also, the tariffs for farmers were tripled, and in 2004, penalties were slapped on around 60,000 defaulters.

In April 2006, Modi surprised all by sitting on a fast, for fifty-one hours, to protest the injustice meted out to Gujarat. The Narmada Valley Authority had granted permission to raise the height of the Sardar Sarovar dam to 100 metres. (The Supreme Court had, in the historic October 2000 judgment, permitted the construction of the dam in tranches, depending on the relief and rehabilitation of the affected people.)

But the water resources minister of the UPA government, Saifuddin Soz, chose to review the decision and thus stall the move. The project, since its inception, has been an emotional issue for Gujaratis, and every chief minister has found support for it cutting across party lines. Modi, in opposing the Centre’s vacillation, sat on a fast in public and forced the UPA government to fast-track the dam construction.

As the election campaign started, it was clear that Modi’s relationship with the voters was intact. At rally after rally, he exhorted people to vote for ‘kamal’ (the lotus, the party symbol) for the single reason: ‘vikas’, development. The Congress, on the other hand, harped on the communal divisions, and its president, Sonia Gandhi, finally dropped a bombshell when she referred to the Modi government as ‘maut ke saudagar’, the merchants of death.

I would say that I would not let a “single-pillar” growth model to develop in the state. The Gujarat model is based on three pillars: industry, services and agriculture. You will get balanced development only if you focus equally on each sector.

In his speech, he made a distinction between padabhar (weight of a post) and karyabhar (weight of duties). Perhaps aware of the circumstances under which he was taking over, Modi invoked the strength of the party’s discipline and organizational strength and recalled the contribution of BJS leader Jagannath Rao Joshi, who had led the movement for the liberation of Goa from Portuguese rule.

There were instances, like when Vajpayee had been declared as the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate ahead of the 1996 Lok Sabha election, when Advani made a decision on his own without wider consultation. The RSS had been nursing a grudge against him on this issue. His decision to capture both the important posts—party president as well as the leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha—was seen as consistent with the streak of unilateralism he had shown in the past while taking decisions on party matters.

The BJP, too, came to power in the 1990s but as part of a coalition, and it had to keep the most significant parts of its founding vision in the deep freezer so as to win more allies and put together numbers to win power. What is noticeable about the rise and rise of the BJP under Modi’s leadership is that it has come along with not a dilution of ideology

For instance, Indira Gandhi’s ‘garibi hatao’ (remove poverty) slogan became popular in the ’70s as the country was still grappling with food shortages. Privation was so pervasive that the rhetoric of poverty removal was enough to move the masses in Indira Gandhi’s favour. As food sufficiency increased, her slogan changed to ‘roti, kapda aur makaan’ (food, clothing and shelter) as the central theme of the political discourse in the ’80s, the period that still laid emphasis on sustenance.

In the state’s traditional political culture, the socialist forces, with the peripheral existence of Marxists, occupied the opposition space, with the Congress playing the role of the principal pole. The BJP, or its progenitor, the BJS, always played a marginal role there. With the advent of Lalu Prasad Yadav in the post-Mandal phase, the political consolidation along caste lines, particularly in favour of the OBCs, became intense. This helped Yadav, who deftly developed his image of a secular OBC leader with pro-Muslim leanings.

It would not be wrong to say that Nitish Kumar crafted his image as antagonistic to Modi in order to win over the Muslims in the state. He was desperate to wrest the support base of Muslims from his arch-rival Lalu Prasad Yadav’s RJD, and he found Modi-bashing a convenient ploy to establish his pro-Muslim credentials within the NDA fold.

Mukerjee was a charismatic leader in his own right and had served as Union minister of industry and supply in Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s cabinet. Though he was part of the cabinet at the time of Gandhi’s assassination, he did not face any criticism on account of his ideological proclivity. He fell out with Nehru on a host of issues, tendered his resignation and founded the BJS—with a small function at a girls’ school in Delhi on 21 October 1951. In its initial years, the BJS largely borrowed from the RSS’s techniques of organizational expansion. Its cadre formed the base on which the political party’s superstructure was built. Though Mukerjee originally belonged to the Mahasabha, whose overtly pro-Hindu leaning was self-evident, he was counted among moderates in his political outlook. Within the BJS too,

In the late ’60s, as anti-Congressism acquired the scale of a serious political challenge to the grand old party, the BJS gradually edged out the hardliners, the Hindu Mahasabha and Ram Rajya Parishad, and even appropriated their support bases and tactically aligned with anti-Congress political formations.

This phase saw the emergence of leaders like Vajpayee and Balraj Madhok at the national level, and also regional leaders like Bhairon Singh Shekhawat in Rajasthan, and Virendra Kumar Saklecha and Kailash Joshi in Madhya Pradesh. But much of the growth was attributed to the tireless work of silent builders, like Sunder Singh Bhandari in Rajasthan and Kushabhau Thakre in Madhya Pradesh. Both worked behind the scenes but had earned tremendous respect within the party.

And there is little doubt that the BJS’s substantial growth was due to these thousands of full-timers and pracharaks who selflessly devoted themselves to the building of the party, right in the spirit of nation-building. In sharp contrast to the surfeit of articulate leaders across the rival political spectrum, the list of big leaders in the BJS was short.

With the advent of Indira Gandhi, there was a massive overhaul of the Congress, in terms of its vision, leadership as well as in its ways of winning power. In the early 1970s, however, her misgovernance and rising inflation were making her unpopular. A students’ revolt in Gujarat in 1974 against Indira Gandhi spread across India and metamorphosed into a widespread agitation. Veteran socialist–Gandhian Jayaprakash Narayan assumed the leadership of this movement. The BJS then found a unique opportunity to expand its influence by aligning itself with this campaign.

The resultant political scenario brought anti-Congress forces together under the banner of the Janata Party, into which the BJS merged itself. For the first time, the BJS gained experience in leading a mass movement across the country by aligning with ideologically disparate political forces.

When on 6 April 1980, a new outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party, came into existence with the help of the leaders of the now-extinct BJS, Modi was not only a keen observer of these developments but also a participant. He was an active RSS worker during the Emergency, when Indira Gandhi banned the organization. (He was active in the underground and overground campaigns against the undemocratic and authoritarian moves of the government.)

In the Lok Sabha polls held in the wake of Indira Gandhi’s assassination, the BJP won only two seats as all its leading lights, including Vajpayee, were defeated. That was the worst phase for the party and the cadres that formed the backbone of its organizational structure.

Modi has kept on emphasizing three critical aspects of his working style to win the trust of the masses. First: ‘I will leave no stone unturned for the benefit of the people and the nation.’ Second: ‘I will do nothing for personal gain.’ Third: ‘I may make bona fide mistakes but won’t do anything with bad intentions.’

The party’s decision to join the JP movement in 1974 was not impulsive but driven by political pragmatism. Similarly, the BJP supported V.P. Singh in his anti-corruption movement against Rajiv Gandhi despite Singh’s often unfriendly utterances. In the course of its political journey, the BJS/BJP not only gained experience in mass movements but also expanded its organizational network to get real feedback from the ground.

You may not be able to solve everyone’s problems, nor do people expect you to solve their issues. All people expect is a little kindness from you, which is ultimately worth more than a solution to their problem. A little kindness gives hope. It assures the other person that they are worthy of being loved and that you will stand by them through their tough times. Moreover, a little kindness proves to you that you are capable of loving.

Unless you feed it to Ibérico pigs, also known as pata negra (black hoof) pigs. The ham made from the legs of these pigs is known as jamón Ibérico. The best quality jamón Ibérico is made with free-range pata negra pigs that only eat acorns in oak forests in the last stages of their lives and is thus called jamón Ibérico de bellota (bellota means acorn in Spanish).5 Acorn gives it a deep nutty flavour that’s impossible to match.

two countries that were at similar levels of economic development in the early 1960s (Korea was in fact much poorer then – in 1961, its per capita income was $93, against Ghana’s $190), Samuel Huntington, the veteran American political scientist and author of the controversial book The Clash of Civilizations, argues: ‘Undoubtedly, many factors played a role, but … culture had to be a large part of the explanation. South Koreans valued thrift, investment, hard work, education, organisation, and discipline. Ghanaians had different values. In short, cultures count.’ Huntington’s description of Confucian culture is a perfect example of positive cultural stereotyping – only picking elements that fit your characterization of a culture that you want to portray in positive light.
